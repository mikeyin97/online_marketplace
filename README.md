Shopify Web Api Challenge

I was not sure whether the title of a product is supposed to be a unique key for a product. 
I will assume that the title of a product is not a unique key for a product. 
Title and price as a composite key will uniquely define a product. 
So if you try to push a product with a same title with a different price, it will still be possible. 


To-do List:
1) Flesh out API
2) Create a shopping cart using the API
3) Create an API for the shopping cart?
4) Unit Tests (in jest?)
5) Documentation (in code as well as in the README)

Extra
5) GraphQL
6) Adding security (passport)
